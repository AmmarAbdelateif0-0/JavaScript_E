DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL: STRUCTURED REPRESENTATION OF HTML DOCUMENTS. ALLOWS JAVASCRIPT TO ACCESS HTML ELEMENTS AND STYLES TO MANIPULATE THEM.


for example , we will be able to change text , HTML  attributes, and even CSS styles.

so we can say that DOM is basically a connection point between HTML Documents and JavaScript code.

==The DOM and DOM Method isn't a part of JavaScript==.

==The DOM and DOM Method are actually part of something called the web APIs==.

So the web APIs are like libraries that browsers implement and that we can access from our JavaScript code.
API stands for Application Programming Interface .


what you need to know is that a web APIs are, basically, libraries that are also written in JavaScript and that are automatically available for us to use, So all this happens behind the scenes, we don't have to import or do anything.

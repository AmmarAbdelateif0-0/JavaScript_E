dynamic actually means ==dynamically-typed.==

So as we've already seen, ==in JavaScript, we don't assign data types to variables.==

Instead, they only became known when==the JavaScript engine executes our code==.

Also, the type of variables can easily be changed as we reassign variables.

And this is basically what dynamically-typed means.


==for most other programming languages, where we have to manually assign types, to variables.==

And this then ==usually prevents bugs from happening==, which is the reason why many people say that JavaScript should be a strongly-typed language as well.

And if you  want to==use JavaScript with types== , then you can always look into ==TypeScript.==

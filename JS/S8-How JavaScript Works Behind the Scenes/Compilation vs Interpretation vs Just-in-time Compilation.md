###  compilation
	
Compilation : ==Entire code is converted into machine code at once==, and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer.

==portable file is a machine code that can run at any machine.==

---------------------------------------------------------------------
### Interpretation

interpretation : Interpreter runs through the source code and ==executes it line by line.==

no portable file here execution direct .

JS was worked  on interpreter but due to the low speed, JS now used by the JIT compilation engine.

### Just-In-Time(JIT) compilation

Just-in-time (JIT) ==compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code at once==, then executed immediately.

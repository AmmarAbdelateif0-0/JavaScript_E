every program that runs on your computer needs some hardware resources, such as memory and the CPU to do its work.

Now, there are== low-level languages,== such as== C,== where you ==have to manually manage these resources.==

For example, asking the computer for memory to create a new variable.

On the other side, you have ==high-level languages ==such as ==JavaScript and Python==, where we ==do not have to manage resources ==at all because these languages ==have so-called abstractions== that take all of that work away from us.

This makes the language easier to learn and to use, but the downside is that programs will never be as fast or as optimized as for example, C programs.

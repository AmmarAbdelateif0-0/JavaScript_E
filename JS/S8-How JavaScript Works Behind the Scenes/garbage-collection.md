one of the powerful tools that takes ==memory management ==away from us developers is ==garbage-collection==, which is basically an ==algorithm inside the JavaScript engine==,== which automatically removes old, unused objects from the computer memory== in order not to clog it up with unnecessary stuff.

So it's a little bit like JavaScript has a cleaning guy who cleans our memory from time to time so that we don't have to do it manually in our code.

JS Engine : is a computer program that executes JS code .

There are a lot of steps involved in doing that, but essentially executing JavaScript code is what an engine does.

Now every browser has its own JavaScript engine but probably the most well known engine is ==Google's V-Eight==.

The V eight engine powers Google Chrome, but also Node.js which is that JavaScript runtime that we talked about in the beginning of the course, so the one that we can use to build server side applications with JavaScript, so outside of any browser.

==what's most important is to actually understand its components and how it works ?==

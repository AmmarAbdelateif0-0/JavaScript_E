##### ==interpreter = just-in-time compiled==


Ultimately, every single program needs to be written in zeros and ones, which is also called machine code.

And since that's not really practical to write, is it? We simply write human-readable JavaScript code, which is an abstraction over machine code, but this code eventually needs to be translated to machine code.

==And that step can be either compiling or interpreting.==

this step is necessary in every single programming language because no one writes machine code manually.

==In the case of JavaScript this happened inside the JavaScript engine ( interpreter )==
